  </p>
      <p>
Hi, my name is Luca and I am a chinese teen who loves video games, recording and editing videos. I also love tennis and math. I am trahs at history and geography. I've been on youtube since I was 5 years old watching my favourate games: Minecraft and Geometry Dash. I started YouTube someone you might know, DarkLightBoy, he use to be my best friend until he did something I didn't appreciate. In took my intrest in coding HTML and Java script. I live in Canada, a beautiful place to live. Thought it is a cold country, but I love the cold unlike other people. I love making friends and do a lot of fun stuff. I think I'll just put this as a bio since I don't have a lot of things to tell.
